# VueJS/Ionic Showcase

This project contains seceral tests and showcases for theming and component library usage.

## Component library showcase

Enter `ionic-vue-testapp` and run `ionic serve`. On the first tab, you should see a "Hello from the other side" message and a few Ionic Elements (Button and Checkbox) that are included from the pattern lib. I'm not sure why the text contents aren't rendered, my feeling is that it's related to how vueJS renders components.

Currently Ionic is installed in both projects. So far I haven't thought about builds, deployments or versioning.

## Theming showcase

...can be found in `./theming-showcase`. Use `ionic serve` to run.
